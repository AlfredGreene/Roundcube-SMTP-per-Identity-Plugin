roundcube-identity-smtp-plugin
==============================

This plugin allows to setup identities with different smtp servers than the servers default.

This plugin works for me but it is not tested very well. Patches are welcome.

INSTALLATION
============

Place the plugin in the roundcubes plugin folder.

USAGE
=====

In the indentities settings you can specify an alternative smtp server for every identity to send mails. When composing a mail just choose the identity you want to use to send a mail.
