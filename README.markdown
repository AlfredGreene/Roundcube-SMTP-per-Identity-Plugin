identity_smtp Roundcube Plugin
==============================

This roundcube plugin allows to setup identities with different smtp servers than the servers default.

This plugin works for me but it is not tested very well. Patches are welcome.

Installation
============

Place the plugin in the roundcubes plugin folder. The plugins folder must be named identity_smtp. The folder stucture should look like this:

	roundcubemail/plugins/identity_smtp/identity_smtp.php

Usage
=====

In the indentities settings you can specify an alternative smtp server for every identity to send mails. When composing a mail just choose the identity you want to use to send a mail.
